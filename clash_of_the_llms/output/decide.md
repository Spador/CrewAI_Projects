Oppose is more persuasive. The opposing argument effectively counters the motion's claims by highlighting the strategic necessity of tariffs to address unfair trade practices like dumping and subsidies from China and India, which the pro side overlooks in favor of idealized free trade principles. It also provides a more nuanced view of long-term benefits, such as fostering domestic resilience and job quality, while acknowledging short-term costs, making it logically superior to the pro side's broader generalizations about inefficiencies and diplomatic risks. Additionally, the oppose side reframes tariffs as a negotiating tool rather than an inevitable cause of trade wars, offering a balanced rebuttal that engages directly with the pro's examples, like the farming industry, by contextualizing them within responses to initial unfair practices.
