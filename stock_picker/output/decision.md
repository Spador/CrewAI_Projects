**Rationale for Selection:**
Broadcom stands out as the top investment candidate due to its solid market position in semiconductor and infrastructure software, driven primarily by advancements in AI technologies. The company's future outlook is highly promising, with projections indicating a revenue leap to $60.02 billion by 2025. Its leadership in custom AI chip markets aligns with booming AI demands, driving potential stock doubling within three years. This robust growth prospect coupled with significant AI industry momentum presents a lucrative investment opportunity.
